# personal-changelog
This is my personal change log for the 30-Day GitHub challenge. 

During Prime, I wanted to join Fred for the morning headspace, but always had an excuse to work on code or something else.

Therefore, my main goal for this challenge is to take time everyday to learn about and practice both mindfulness and meditation.
